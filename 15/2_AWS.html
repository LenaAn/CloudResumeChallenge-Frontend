    <h3>How did I prepare</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        - Free courses on Aws SkillBuilder: -- Exam Prep: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) вЂ” AWS Technical
        Essentials - Practice tests on udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-c/
        (Questions are slightly more difficult than in the real exam)
    </div>

    <h3>What does the exam check</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        AWS Cloud Practitioner foundational exam. Whether you're a devOps developer or a sales person, this is a good start for
        everyone. Therefore, the content there is a bit general and there is something that needs to be taught specifically for
        the exam. Even if you have a lot of experience in projects on AWS, you hardly remember that the designated Technical
        Account manager is available in Enterprise support (which costs $15k per month). But basically, the test can be passed
        on common sense and experience - questions like what is agility, what determines the cost of EC2, what file system can
        be mounted simultaneously on several EC2 machines?
    </div>

    <h3>How is the exam going</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        There are 65 questions in the exam, 50 of them count, 15 do not. These are new questions they are testing. What
        questions count, you don't know. The exam is given 90 minutes. For the exam, you can get from 100 to 1000 points, the
        passing score is 700. I passed 827. The exam costs $100. In some cities there is a testing center where you can come and
        pass. Otherwise, you can take the exam at home through Pearson Vue. You need a room where no one is distracting, before
        the start of the exam you need to clean the room, remove everything unnecessary from the table, remove additional
        monitors, notebooks, and in general everything suspicious. During the exam, the proctor looks at you through the camera
        and makes sure you don't cheat. You canвЂ™t leave the view of the camera, you canвЂ™t read questions aloud, and itвЂ™s
        better not to look anywhere except for the monitor (the only one!) If the risks are that the Internet will fall off in
        the process or the neighbors will be distracting, or the phone will ring, then the exam may not be counted.
    </div>

    <h3>Why is it necessary</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        Formally, there is no need. But I like to take exams as a way to systematize learning and as a mark for myself - so, at
        such and such a moment I was at that level. Another motivation is that I want to make
        https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/, and here the first step is to get certified. Of course, no one
        will stop me from passing the challenge even without certification, but itвЂ™s calmer in my soul.
        waiting.
    </div>

        <h3>What's next</h3>
        <div class="string length">
            AWS has a lot of certifications, I'm looking at Associate Solutions Architect, but before that I want to dig deeper into
            AWS with my hands.
