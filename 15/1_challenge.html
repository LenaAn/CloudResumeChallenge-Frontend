    <h3>Setting Up HTTPS with Amazon CloudFront</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        <p>Today, I'm continuing to work on the task at &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/" class="special-link move-left">cloudresumechallenge.dev</a>, and my plan has two main points:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>HTTPS</strong>: The S3 website URL should use HTTPS for security. Amazon
                CloudFront will be needed for this.</li>
            <li class="list-item"><strong>DNS</strong>: Set up a custom DNS domain name for the CloudFront distribution,
                allowing your resume to be accessed at something like <a href="my-c00l-resume-website.com" class="special-link move-left2">my-c00l-resume-website.com</a>. You can use Amazon Route
                53 or any other DNS provider. Domain name registration usually costs about ten dollars.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Implementing HTTPS</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        The first part was relatively straightforward, although, of course, it didn't work the first time. I decided not to use
        the provided CloudFormation stacks, as I wanted to click the buttons myself for the first time. So, I went to the
        CloudFront interface, created a distribution, and specified the S3 bucket as the origin.
        
        I had to configure whether my distribution would accept HTTP or HTTPS. I did all this to ensure clients don't use
        insecure HTTP, so I configured HTTP to redirect to HTTPS. However, I made a mistake because my S3 bucket does not
        support HTTPS (as far as I understand). After fixing it, I closed public access to the S3 bucket. Now, everything seems
        to be in order: you can only access the S3 bucket through HTTPS via CloudFront. Then, I went to grab a bite to eat.
    </div>

    <h3>Registering a Domain</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        I had a mediocre wok with udon noodles, beef, tofu, teriyaki sauce, and red sauce. After that, I went to a coffee shop,
        got a coffee and brownie, and it was time to register a domain!
        
        Last year, I registered lenaan.io for $11/year through GoDaddy but ended up not using it. So, I opened Route 53, and
        there was a big "Register Domain" button. I decided to save money and registered lenaan.link for $6/year. They said
        registration would take up to 3 days, but I received an email soon after, and I already had a domain while enjoying
        dessert.
    </div>

    <h3>Connecting Domain to CloudFront Distribution</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        AWS services have a massive amount of documentation and step-by-step guides, so it's unclear where you are in each
        tutorial. I decided not to follow the steps I didn't understand and went to Route 53 Hosted Zones to add a record. I
        needed to redirect to my CloudFront distribution, but Route 53 didn't find it and mentioned something about us-east-1.
    </div>

    <h3>Obtaining a Certificate</h3>
    <div class="string length">
        After some research, I found that I needed to add my domain to the CloudFront distribution as an alternative name and
        obtain a certificate for my domain in AWS Certificate Manager. I had read about it in tutorials but didn't understand
        what it was and why, so I initially ignored it. Now it's clear! I requested a certificate, wrote this post, and now I'm
        waiting.
